## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete source code for **Diamonds by Raymond Lee** — a premium online jewelry boutique specializing in engagement rings, fine jewelry, and luxury diamonds.

- Entire theme developed from a blank slate using Shopify's Online Store 2.0 architecture
- Zero usage of Dawn, Impulse, Prestige, Broadcast, or any other published/premium theme
- All templates, sections, snippets, assets, and logic were written manually
- Primary goals: pixel-perfect brand presentation, performance, accessibility, and seamless luxury shopping experience
